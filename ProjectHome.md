**DO NOT INSTALL FONTROUTER ON SYMBIAN^3 DEVICES, IT MAY BRICK YOUR DEVICE**

FontRouter is an open font rasterizer plug-in (also called "font driver") for Symbian. It is started about 4 years ago, initially for improving the Chinese font support on Symbian.

With more than 3 years' development, FontRouter extended its functionality to language-neutral & UI-independent and give user more controls over font mechanism on Symbian, such as loading 3rd-party font file, font substitution, size adjustment.

For some personal reasons, FontRouter project was discontinued for more than one year, but many users still kept writing to me for suggestion and bug report in these days. Since I can't face their expectation, I decided to open source and wish it a better future.

As discussed and reconsidered carefully, I released the source code under Apache License 2.0, but not GPL. I hope someone or even some commercial company could continue or derive from this project and present a quality production for the Symbian community.

If you are considering continuing this project or deriving from it, please mail to me, and I will give my support.

**SUPPORT WILL ONLY BE OFFERED TO OPEN SOURCE CONTINUATION OR DERIVATION.**

For developers who want to build FontRouter source, please read "[Build](Build.md)" first.

**对方正无视开源协议盗用FontRouter源码行为的严正声明**

作为一款内置收费服务的商业软件，目前已经掌握的充分证据显示“方正字酷”大量使用了FontRouter开源项目的源码，却未履行“Apache License 2.0”的要求在软件本身的发布包及网站中附带任何对源码使用的声明和协议文本，已经构成了对开源协议的恣意践踏。

在此提出严正声明，要求“北京北大方正电子有限公司”立即停止上述侵权行为，并就已经造成的不良影响在媒体上公开道歉！
